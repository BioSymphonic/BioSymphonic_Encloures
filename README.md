BioSymphonic Enclosures

Open 3D printable mechanical systems for BioSymphonic devices.

By [BioSymphonic LLC](https://biosymphonic.com/)

This repository contains enclosure designs and reusable mechanical
components developed for sensor-based environmental instruments and art
installations.



## Repository Structure

**Projects**

Device-specific mechanical systems.

**Shared**

Reusable components intended to work across multiple devices.


## Organization

Project folders may follow a structure such as:

Projects/AirQuality_Node/

Each project or shared component may contain:

-   F360/ --- Fusion 360 source files (.f3d)
-   step/ --- Neutral CAD files (.step / .stp)
-   stl/ --- Print-ready files (.stl)
-   notes.md --- Print or assembly notes (optional)

Notes and documentation may live inside each subdirectory.


## File Formats

When available, each design includes:

.f3d --- Fusion 360 source with parametric history

.step / .stp --- Interoperable CAD format

.stl --- Print-ready mesh file

Providing multiple formats supports collaboration, interoperability, and
direct fabrication.
